# Integrated Circuits & Transistors

- **Very-large-scale integration (VLSI)** is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining millions or billions of MOS transistors onto a single chip.
- **metal–oxide–semiconductor** field-effect transistor (MOS transistor) is a type of field-effect transistor (FET), most commonly fabricated by the controlled oxidation of silicon
- **Field-effect transistor (FET)**
