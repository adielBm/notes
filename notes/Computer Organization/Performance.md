- The **clock cycle** time (CCT) is the time for one clock period (usually of the processor clock, which runs at a constant rate, usually published as part of the documentation for a computer)
	- note: Although clock cycle time has traditionally been fixed, to save energy or temporarily boost performance, todayâ€™s processors can vary their clock rates, so we would need to use the average clock rate for a program.
- The **clock rate** (CR) is the inverse of the clock cycle time 
	- $\displaystyle\text{CR}=\frac{1}{\text{CCT}}$
	- (usually measured in $\mathsf{Hz}$ or its multiples)
# Single-Cycle


- The **response time** (or **execution time**) is the total time required for the computer to complete a task (including disk accesses, memory accesses, I/O activities, operating system overhead, CPU execution time, etc.)
	- The **latency** is the time it takes to complete an individual instruction
		- (note: the latency can refer to (i) the number of stages in a pipeline. or (ii) The number of stages between two instructions during execution)
		- #todo latency = execution time ?
		- $\mathrm{Latency}=\mathrm{CPI} \times \mathrm{CCT}$
- The **performance** is the reciprocal of response time: $\displaystyle\text{Performance}_X = \frac{1}{\text{Response time}_X}$
- The **CPU (execution) time** (of task) is the actual time the CPU spends computing for a specific task (excluding other activities) 
- The **throughput** (or **bandwidth**) is the number of tasks (instructions) completed per unit time
- $\text{CPU Clock Cycles} = \text{IC} \times \text{CPI}$
	- The **instruction count** (IC) is the number of instructions executed by the program
	- The **clock cycles per instruction** (CPI) is the average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment
	- The **CPU clock cycles** (or **total clock cycles**) is the total number of clock cycles consumed by the program 
- The **CPU (execution) time** (of program) is 
	- $\text{Execution Time} = \text{IC}\times \text{CPI} \times \text{CCT}=\frac{\text{CPU clock cycles}}{\text{Clock rate}}$


- $\displaystyle\text{CPU Clock Cycles}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{IC}_i \times \text{CPI}_i$
	- $\text{IC}_i$ is the number of instructions of type $i$
	- $\text{CPI}_i$ is the average number of clock cycles per instruction of type $i$




> The number of instructions in the program (IC) is determined by the efficiency of the algorithm implementation, the compiler, and the processor's instruction set architecture (ISA). 
> The implementation of the processor determines both the clock cycle time and the CPI.



### Instruction Replacement

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Given  
> - $\text{CR} = 3\,\mathsf{GHz}$  
> - $\text{CPI}_A = 9\,\mathsf{cc/ins}$ 
> - $\text{CPI}_B = 2\,\mathsf{cc/ins}$ 
> - Some of the $A$ instructions in the program are replaced by $B$ instructions, after which, the program gets shorter by $3\,\mathsf{sec}$  
> - Each two $A$ instructions are replaced by five $B$ instructions.
> 
>**Question**: How many $A$ instructions were replaced?
> 
> **Answer:**
> - $\text{CPI}_A = 9\,\mathsf{cc/ins} \implies$ 2 $A$ instructions has $18\,\mathsf{cc}$ 
> - $\text{CPI}_B = 2\,\mathsf{cc/ins} \implies$ 5 $B$ instructions has $10\,\mathsf{cc}$ 
> - Therefore, by replacing 2 $A$ instructions with 5 $B$ instructions, we save $8\,\mathsf{cc}$, thus, by replacing one $A$ instruction, we save $4\,\mathsf{cc}$.
> - The cycles saved = $3\,\mathsf{sec} \times 3\,\mathsf{GHz} = 9 \times 10^9\,\mathsf{cc}$
> - The number of $A$ instructions replaced = $\frac{9 \times 10^9}{4} = 2.25 \times 10^9$
>  


$$\displaystyle\mathrm{N}_{A}={\frac{a \cdot \Delta T \cdot \text{CR}}{a \cdot \text{CPI}_A - b \cdot \text{CPI}_B}}$$

- Every $a$ instructions of type $A$ replaced by $b$ instructions of type $B$
- $\Delta T$ is the time saved (in $\mathsf{sec}$)
- $\text{CR}$ is the clock rate of the CPU (in $\mathsf{Hz}$)
- $\text{CPI}_A$ and $\text{CPI}_B$ are the cycles per instruction for $A$ and $B$ (resp.)
- $\mathrm{N}_A$ is the total number of $A$ instructions replaced

### Instruction Count

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Given  
> - CPU A with $\text{CPI}=5.5$, and $\text{Clock rate}=2\text{ GHz}$  
> - CPU B with $\text{CPI}=2.2$, and $\text{Clock rate}=3\text{ GHz}$
> - A program with $200,000$ instructions in running time (after assembly for CPU A)  
> 
> How many instructions (in running time) would CPU B execute to match the running time of CPU A? 
> - $\text{ET}_A = \text{ET}_B$ (ET=Execution Time)  
> - $\frac{\text{IC}_A \times \text{CPI}_A}{\text{Clock rate}_A} = \frac{\text{IC}_B \times \text{CPI}_B}{\text{Clock rate}_B}$  
> - $\frac{200,000 \times 5.5}{2} = \frac{\text{IC}_B \times 2.2}{3}$  
> - $\text{IC}_B = \frac{200,000 \times 5.5 \times 3}{2 \times 2.2}=750,000$  

$$\displaystyle\text{ET}_{A}=\text{ET}_{B} \implies \frac{\text{IC}_{A} \times \text{CPI}_{A}}{\text{CR}_{A}} = \frac{\text{IC}_{B} \times \text{CPI}_{B}}{\text{CR}_{B}}\implies \boxed{\text{IC}_{B} = \frac{\text{IC}_{A} \times \text{CPI}_{A} \times \text{CR}_{B}}{\text{CPI}_{B} \times \text{CR}_{A}}}$$

# Pipelining 

> In this section, $\mathrm{CPI}=1$, therefore, $\mathrm{Latency}=\mathrm{CCT}$


- The **pipeline depth** is the number of stages ($=5$) in the pipeline
- $\{\mathrm{IF},\mathrm{ID},\mathrm{EX},\mathrm{MEM},\mathrm{WB}\}$ are the **stage delay** in the pipeline

$\mathrm{Latency_{pipelined}}=\mathrm{CCT_{pipelined}} \times \text{pipeline-depth}$



	- $\displaystyle\mathrm{Latency_{pipelined}}=\frac{\text{Execution-time}} {\text{Number-of-instructions}}$  #todo is it correct


- $\mathrm{CCT_{single}}=\mathrm{IF}+\mathrm{ID}+\mathrm{EX}+\mathrm{MEM}+\mathrm{WB}$
- $\mathrm{CCT_{pipelined}}=\max(\mathrm{IF},\mathrm{ID},\mathrm{EX},\mathrm{MEM},\mathrm{WB})$

- $\displaystyle\text{Throughput}=\frac{1}{\text{CCT}}$
- $\displaystyle{\text{ET}}(n)={\text{CCT}}\times (n+\text{depth}-1)$

> Although the _latency_ is worse in the pipelined processor, the _throughput_ is significantly improved


- $\displaystyle\mathrm{Speedup}=\frac{\mathrm{Latency_{single}}}{\mathrm{Latency_{pipelined}}}=\frac{\mathrm{CPI_{single}}\times \mathrm{CCT_{single}}}{\mathrm{CPI_{pipelined}}\times \mathrm{CCT_{pipelined}}}$

- $\displaystyle\text{Speedup}=\frac{\text{Pipeline-depth}}{1+\text{Pipeline stall CPI}}\times \frac{\text{CCT}_{\text{single}}}{\text{CCT}_{\text{pipelined}}}$


	
	
	
	- $\displaystyle\lim_{N\to \infty} \frac{(N\cdot \mathrm{Latency_{single}})+\mathrm{Overhead_{single}}}{(N\cdot \mathrm{Latency_{pipelined}})+\mathrm{Overhead_{pipelined}}}$ is the speedup of the pipelined processor over the single-cycle processor, where:
		- $\mathrm{Overhead_{single}}$ and $\mathrm{Overhead_{pipelined}}$ are the time taken to execute some given number of instructions, for the single-cycle and pipelined processors, respectively.
- When the stages are perfectly balanced, then:
	- $\displaystyle\mathrm{CCT_{pipelined}}=\frac{\mathrm{CCT_{single}}}{\mathrm{depth}}$, thus, $\displaystyle\mathrm{Speedup}=\mathrm{depth}$ (Under ideal conditions and with a large number of instructions)




> [!Exercise]

> 	- $\mathrm{EX}=350\,\mathsf{ps}$

> - C. For a large number of instructions, what is the speedup of the pipelined processor over the single-cycle processor?
> - D. If it is possible to split one stage into two stages, each taking half the time of the original stage. 
> 	- What is the best choice of stage to split? 
> 	- What would be the new clock cycle time of the pipelined processor? 
> 	- What would be the new latency of the `lw` instruction?
> 	- How does the change affect the throughput?
>  
>  #### **Answer**
> - $\mathrm{CCT_{single}}=\mathrm{IF}+\mathrm{ID}+\mathrm{EX}+\mathrm{MEM}+\mathrm{WB}=1650\,\mathsf{ps}$  
> - $\mathrm{CCT_{pipelined}}=\max(\mathrm{IF},\mathrm{ID},\mathrm{EX},\mathrm{MEM},\mathrm{WB})=500\,\mathsf{ps}$
> - $\mathrm{Latency_{single}}=\mathrm{CCT_{single}}=1650\,\mathsf{ps}$  
> - $\mathrm{Latency_{pipelined}}=\mathrm{CCT_{pipelined}} \times \mathrm{depth}=500\,\mathsf{ps} \times 5=2500\,\mathsf{ps}$
> - $\mathrm{Speedup}=\frac{\mathrm{Latency_{single}}}{\mathrm{CCT_{pipelined}}}=3.3$ (given that there is no stalls)
> - The best choice to split is the longest stage, which is the `MEM` stage with $500\,\mathsf{ps}$, that will be split into two stages each taking $250\,\mathsf{ps}$, thus the new longest stage will be the `ID` stage with $400\,\mathsf{ps}$, and the new clock cycle time will be $400\,\mathsf{ps}$, the new latency will be $400\,\mathsf{ps} \times 6=2400\,\mathsf{ps}$, the throughput will be improved as the clock cycle time is reduced.
> - The speedup of the pipelined processor (with the split stage) over the single-cycle processor is $\frac{1650\,\mathsf{ps}}{400\,\mathsf{ps}}=4.125$, and over the pipelined processor (without the split stage) is $\frac{500\,\mathsf{ps}}{400\,\mathsf{ps}}=1.25$

# Speedup

- The **speedup** is it is the improvement in speed of execution of a task executed on two similar architectures with different resources
- Speedup can be defined for two different types of quantities: latency and throughput
	- $\displaystyle S_{\text{L}} = \frac{\text{Latency}_{\text{old}}}{\text{Latency}_{\text{new}}}$ 
	- $\displaystyle S_{\text{T}} = \frac{\text{Throughput}_{\text{new}}}{\text{Throughput}_{\text{old}}}$


### Amdahl's Law

$$\displaystyle\text{Speedup}(N)=\frac{1}{(1-P)+\frac{P}{N}}=\frac{\mathrm{ET}_{\text{old}}}{\mathrm{ET}_{\text{new}}}$$


- $N$ is the number of processors
- $P$ is the fraction of the program that can be parallelized
- $1-P$ is the fraction of the program that must be executed sequentially
- $\text{Speedup}(N)$ is the speedup of the program when executed on $N$ processors
- $\text{ET}_{\text{old}}$ and $\text{ET}_{\text{new}}$ are the execution times of the program before and after the improvement (resp.)
