# CPU Performance

- **clock cycle (time)** is the time for one clock period (usually of the processor clock, which runs at a constant rate, usually published as part of the documentation for a computer)
	- note: Although clock cycle time has traditionally been fixed, to save energy or temporarily boost performance, todayâ€™s processors can vary their clock rates, so we would need to use the average clock rate for a program.
- **clock rate** (CR) is the inverse of the clock cycle time (usually measured in $\mathsf{Hz}$ or its multiples)


- **response time** (or **execution time**) is the total time required for the computer to complete a task (including disk accesses, memory accesses, I/O activities, operating system overhead, CPU execution time, etc.)
- **performance** is the reciprocal of response time $$\text{Performance}_X = \frac{1}{\text{Response time}_X}$$

- **CPU (execution) time** (of task) is the actual time the CPU spends computing for a specific task (excluding other activities) 
- **throughput** (or **bandwidth**) is the number of tasks completed per unit time

#### Program Performance

In this subsection, we refer to the performance of some program in a the CPU.
$$\text{CPU clock cycles} = \text{IC} \times \text{CPI}$$

- **instruction count** (IC) is the number of instructions executed by the program
- **cycles per instruction** (CPI) is the average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment
- **CPU clock cycles** is the total number of clock cycles consumed by the program 


- **CPU (execution) time** (of program) is $$\text{CPU time for program} = \text{CPU clock cycles} \times \text{Clock cycle time}=\frac{\text{CPU clock cycles}}{\text{Clock rate}}$$

### Instruction Replacement


> [!EXAMPLE]
> Given  
> - $\text{CR} = 3\,\mathsf{GHz}$  
> - $\text{CPI}_A = 9\,\mathsf{cc/ins}$ 
> - $\text{CPI}_B = 2\,\mathsf{cc/ins}$ 
> - Some of the $A$ instructions in the program are replaced by $B$ instructions, after which, the program gets shorter by $3\,\mathsf{sec}$  
> - Each two $A$ instructions are replaced by five $B$ instructions.
> 
>**Question**: How many $A$ instructions were replaced?
> 
> **Answer:**
> - $\text{CPI}_A = 9\,\mathsf{cc/ins} \implies$ 2 $A$ instructions has $18\,\mathsf{cc}$ 
> - $\text{CPI}_B = 2\,\mathsf{cc/ins} \implies$ 5 $B$ instructions has $10\,\mathsf{cc}$ 
> - Therefore, by replacing 2 $A$ instructions with 5 $B$ instructions, we save $8\,\mathsf{cc}$, thus, by replacing one $A$ instruction, we save $4\,\mathsf{cc}$.
> - The cycles saved = $3\,\mathsf{sec} \times 3\,\mathsf{GHz} = 9 \times 10^9\,\mathsf{cc}$
> - The number of $A$ instructions replaced = $\frac{9 \times 10^9}{4} = 2.25 \times 10^9$

$$\displaystyle\mathrm{N}_{A}={\frac{a \cdot \Delta T \cdot \text{CR}}{a \cdot \text{CPI}_A - b \cdot \text{CPI}_B}}$$

- Every $a$ instructions of type $A$ replaced by $b$ instructions of type $B$
- $\Delta T$ is the time saved (in $\mathsf{sec}$)
- $\text{CR}$ is the clock rate of the CPU (in $\mathsf{Hz}$)
- $\text{CPI}_A$ and $\text{CPI}_B$ are the cycles per instruction for $A$ and $B$ (resp.)
- $\mathrm{N}_A$ is the total number of $A$ instructions replaced

### Instruction Count

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Given  
> - CPU A with $\text{CPI}=5.5$, and $\text{Clock rate}=2\text{ GHz}$  
> - CPU B with $\text{CPI}=2.2$, and $\text{Clock rate}=3\text{ GHz}$
> - A program with $200,000$ instructions in running time (after assembly for CPU A)  
> 
> How many instructions (in running time) would CPU B execute to match the running time of CPU A? 
> - $\text{ET}_A = \text{ET}_B$ (ET=Execution Time)  
> - $\frac{\text{IC}_A \times \text{CPI}_A}{\text{Clock rate}_A} = \frac{\text{IC}_B \times \text{CPI}_B}{\text{Clock rate}_B}$  
> - $\frac{200,000 \times 5.5}{2} = \frac{\text{IC}_B \times 2.2}{3}$  
> - $\text{IC}_B = \frac{200,000 \times 5.5 \times 3}{2 \times 2.2}=750,000$  

$$\displaystyle\text{ET}_{A}=\text{ET}_{B} \implies \frac{\text{IC}_{A} \times \text{CPI}_{A}}{\text{CR}_{A}} = \frac{\text{IC}_{B} \times \text{CPI}_{B}}{\text{CR}_{B}}\implies \boxed{\text{IC}_{B} = \frac{\text{IC}_{A} \times \text{CPI}_{A} \times \text{CR}_{B}}{\text{CPI}_{B} \times \text{CR}_{A}}}$$





# Amdahl's Law

$$\displaystyle\text{Speedup}(N)=\frac{1}{(1-P)+\frac{P}{N}}=\frac{\mathrm{ET}_{\text{old}}}{\mathrm{ET}_{\text{new}}}$$


- $N$ is the number of processors
- $P$ is the fraction of the program that can be parallelized
- $1-P$ is the fraction of the program that must be executed sequentially
- $\text{Speedup}(N)$ is the speedup of the program when executed on $N$ processors
- $\text{ET}_{\text{old}}$ and $\text{ET}_{\text{new}}$ are the execution times of the program before and after the improvement (resp.)
