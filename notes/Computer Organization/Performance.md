# Performance

- processor performance:
	- **clock cycle (time)** is the time for one clock period (usually of the processor clock, which runs at a constant rate, usually published as part of the documentation for a computer)
		- note: Although clock cycle time has traditionally been fixed, to save energy or temporarily boost performance, todayâ€™s processors can vary their clock rates, so we would need to use the average clock rate for a program.
	- **clock rate** is the inverse of the clock cycle time (usually measured in $\mathsf{Hz}$ or its multiples)
	- **response time** (or **execution time**) is the total time required for the computer to complete a task (including disk accesses, memory accesses, I/O activities, operating system overhead, CPU execution time, etc.)
	- **performance** is the reciprocal of response time $$\text{Performance}_X = \frac{1}{\text{Response time}_X}$$
	- **CPU (execution) time** (of task) is the actual time the CPU spends computing for a specific task (excluding other activities) 
	- **throughput** (or **bandwidth**) is the number of tasks completed per unit time
- program performance:
	- **instruction count** is the number of instructions executed by the program
	- **CPI (cycles per instruction)** is the average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment
	- **CPU clock cycles** is the total number of clock cycles consumed by the program $$\text{CPU clock cycles} = \text{Instruction count} \times \text{CPI}$$
	- **CPU (execution) time** (of program) is $$\text{CPU time for program} = \text{CPU clock cycles} \times \text{Clock cycle time}=\frac{\text{CPU clock cycles}}{\text{Clock rate}}$$
