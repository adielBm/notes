- (undirected/directed graph)
	- A **Hamiltonian path** is a path that visits each vertex $v\in V$ exactly once. 
	- A **Hamiltonian cycle** is a cycle that visits each vertex $v\in V$ exactly once, except the starting vertex.
	- A **Hamiltonian graph** is a graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle.

- (3.2, Ore's Theorem) A simple graph with $n$ vertices ($n\geq 3$) is **Hamiltonian** if, for every pair of non-adjacent vertices, the sum of their degrees is $n$ or greater.
- (3.3, Dirac's Theorem) A simple graph with $n\geq 3$ vertices is **Hamiltonian** if every vertex has degree $\frac{n}{2}$ or greater.
- (q3.6) A simple graph with $n\geq 3$ vertices, and $n$ is **odd**, and every vertex has degree $\frac{n}{2}-1$ at least, then it contains **Hamiltonian path**.
- (q3.7) $K_{a,b}$ [[Graphs#Bipartite graph|complete bipartite]] graph is contain Hamiltonian cycle, if and only if, $a=b$ and $a,b\geq{2}$
