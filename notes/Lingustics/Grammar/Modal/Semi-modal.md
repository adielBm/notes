*Semi-modals* can behave grammatically either like lexical verbs or like core modal verbs.

## need

#obligation #duty #necessity #requirement

- `need [NP]` - *I need your help*
- `need to [VP]` - *The car needs to be washed*
	- *you need to sit down* #imperative 
- `need for [NP] to [VP]` - *I need for this to happen*
- `need [NP] to [VP]` - *I need this to happen*
	- *I need you to sit down* #imperative  
- `need [gerund-participle]` - *The car needs washing*
- `need [V3]` - *The car needs washed*
- As a **modal verb**, with a bare infinitive; in negative polarity contexts, such as questions (“Need I say more?” “Need you have paid so much?”), with negative expressions such as not (“It need not happen today”; “No one need ever know”), and with similar constructions (“There need only be one”; “it need be signed only by the president”; “I need hardly explain it”). Need in this use does not have inflected forms, aside from the contraction needn’t.

### used to
- Past #habit 
- The negative of *used to* is most typically *didn’t use to* (_I didn’t use to like jazz_). In more formal styles, *used not to* occurs (_I used not to like jazz_). The contracted form *usedn’t to* may occasionally occur, but is very rare
- The interrogative of used to has two forms; the more common form is with auxiliary did. (_Did you used to like jazz_) The alternative form involves subject-verb inversion (*Used you to like jazz*), and is very rare

### ought to

#duty #correctness #probability  #desirable #ideal

- Interrogative form (***Ought** we **to** call the police?*)
- Negative form (*I **ought not to** go)
- Question tags (*This picture **ought to** be hung somewhere, **oughtn’t** it?*)
- Interrogatives, negatives and question tags with *ought to* are very rare; should is generally preferred instead (*This picture **ought to** be hung somewhere, **shouldn’t** it?*)
