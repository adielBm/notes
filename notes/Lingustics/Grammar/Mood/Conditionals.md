- **Conditionals** can be simple/progressive, and active/passive 
## **Condition clause**

 - Using *will* and *shall* in condition clause
	- https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/181572/using-will-after-if , 
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_conditional_sentences#Use_of_will_and_would_in_condition_clauses

## **Main clause** 

can be indicative, interrogative, and imperative. (in imperative, the action needs to be present)  
- Past Perfect (Action in 3rd and mixed cond.) can be replaced with ***were to have + (past participle)***.
	- *If you **had called** me, I would have come.* -> *If you **were to have called** me, I would have come.* 

- ***if*** can be replaced with ***when***

# Conditionals

## Zero Conditional 

- Occasionally, mainly in a formal and somewhat archaic style, a **subjunctive** is used in the **condition clause**

## First Conditional

- **Condition clause**
	- Present. (simple/progressive), (active/passive), (perfect/no-perfect)
		- (perfect) Will you wake him if he **hasn't stirred** by 10 o'clock?
- **Main clause** 
	- (indicative) 
		- usually *Modal-Present* (usually *will*. in 1st person often *shall*)
			- *If I **see** him, I **will** tell him.* 
		- sometimes *Modal-Past*:
		- sometimes *Past*
			- *If it rains this afternoon, then yesterday's weather forecast **was** wrong.* (deduction about the past)
		- sometimes Present: 
			- If it rains this afternoon, your garden party is doomed. (deduction placed in the present)
	- in **imperative** is obviously not modal
		- If it rains this afternoon, **come round** to my place!
		- *if you see it, **photograph** it*
- *if* can be replaced with *unless, as long as, as soon as* or *in case*
	- I'll leave as soon as the babysitter arrives.
	- I don't want to stay in London unless I get a well-paid job.
- in *indirect speech reported* in the past tense, the first conditional naturally changes to the second: *She'll kill me if she finds out.* --> *He said I would kill him if I found out.*
- In colloquial English, an imperative may be used with the meaning of a condition clause, as in "go eastwards a mile and you'll see it" (meaning "if you go eastwards a mile, you will see it").

## Second Conditional (hypothetical present/future)

- **Condition clause**
	- Past. (simple/progressive), (active/passive), (perfect/no-perfect)
		- meaning:  (hypothetical) present or future time frame (for past time frames the third conditional is used)
			- (present) If I liked parties, I would attend more of them.
			- (future) If it rained tomorrow, people would dance in the street.
	- were to + infinitive 
		- If I flew, ... / If I were to fly, ... / Were I to fly, ...
- **Main clause** 
	- usually *Modal-Past* (usually *would*. in 1st person often should)
## Third Conditional (hypothetical past)

- **Condition clause
	- usually Past Perfect
		- If you **had called** me, I would have come.
	- were to have + past participle
		- If you **were to have called** me, I would have come.

- **Main clause** 
	- usually *Modal-Past* (usually *would have*. in 1st person often *should have*)
