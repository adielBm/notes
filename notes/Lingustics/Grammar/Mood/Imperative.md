English usually omits the subject pronoun in imperative sentences:

-   *You work hard*. (indicative)
-   ***Work** hard!* (imperative; subject pronoun _you_ omitted)

## Negative imperative

English imperatives are negated using _don't_ (as in "Don't work!") This is a case of _do_-support as found in indicative clauses; however, in the imperative it applies even in the case of the verb _be_ (which does not use _do_-support in the indicative):

-   *You **are not** late.* (indicative)
-   ***Don't be** late!* (imperative)

## do-support in affirmative imperatives

It is also possible to use do-support in affirmative imperatives, for emphasis or (sometimes) politeness: 
- ***Do** be quiet!*
- ***Do** help yourself!*

## Subject and Pronouns

The subject you may be included for emphasis (It's sound very direct)
- *A: Can I leave the room? B: No. **You** stay here.*
- *Don't **you** dare do that again!*
- *Don't **you** dare laugh!*
- *Don’t **you** worry. Everything will be okay.*

We can also use words like someone, somebody, no one, nobody, everyone, everybody, especially in speaking:

- ***Somebody** call a doctor. Quick!*
- ***Everybody** sit down, please.*
- *It’s a surprise party, so **don’t anybody** mention it to Jim*.

## short responses

*A: Shall I show everyone the old photo of you?
B: No, **don’t**. It’s terrible!*

## Question tags

We sometimes use question tags with imperatives. They make the imperative less direct:

- *Turn on the light, **will you?***
- *Ask him, **can you?***

***Won’t you?*** adds more emphasis to the imperative:
- *Write to me, **won’t you?***

The tag after a negative imperative is normally ***will you***:
- *Don’t tell anyone, **will you?***

- (formal) ***Let us** begin by welcoming our new members.*
