### past #subjunctive

In the traditional past subjunctive, ***were*** is used with all subjects, though many speakers do not actually distinguish the past subjunctive from the past indicative, and therefore use was with first- and third-person singular subjects even in cases where other speakers would use were.

- *I wish I **were** rich.* 
- *If she **were** here, she would know what to do.*
- *If your father **were** alive, he would help you.*
- *I wish that it **were** Sunday.*
- *I wish that I **were** with you.*

with “if” omitted, put first in an “if” clause:
- **Were** it simply that she wore a hat, I would not be upset at all. (= **If** it **were** simply...)
- **Were** father a king, we would have war. (= **If** father **were** a king,...)

### *for* 
- It is best **for her to stay** here tonight.
- It's important **for Norah to win** the competition.
- It's better **for him to do** it on his own.
