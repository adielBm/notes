## draft question

```
Now I'm studying *passive voice* and I'm trying to summarize the rules for myself in tables (below). I'm trying to figure out some things.

1. I noticed that *passive* has the same rules as an *adjective*, just instead of *Past Participle* (V3) an adjective appears. (e.g. *I am happy*, *I was happy*, *I will be happy*, etc.) Is and when is this true? 
2. Is it possible to use the same way as *get passive* for an adjective? (e.g. *I get happy, I got happy, I will get happy,* etc.), and will it have a different meaning?
3. What are the differences between *be-passive* and *get-passive*?

I would appreciate if you have any comments or things that should be added in the summary in my table. (There may be mistakes, this is my summary and I'm just learning now)

Any help would be appreciated
