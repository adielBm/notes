# Electric charge

- Electric charge is **quantized**, that is, exists in discrete quantities which are integer multiples of the **elementary charge** $e=1.6022\times 10 ^{-19}\,\mathsf{C}\approx 1.6\times 10^{-19}\,\mathsf{C}$
	- The charge of an electron is $-e$ and the charge of a proton is $+e$
	- The SI unit of charge is the **coulomb** (C)
- **Conservation of charge**: the total charge in an isolated system remains constant
- An object can become charged by:
	- rubbing (friction)
	- conduction (transfer of charge from one charged object to another by touching)
	- induction

\usepackage{xcolor,tikz,amsmath}
\newcommand*\circled[2]{\tikz[baseline=(char.base)]{\node[shape=circle,draw,fill=#1,inner sep=2pt] (char) {#2};}}

- $\displaystyle F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$ is the **electrostatic force** (orÂ **Coulomb force**) between two charges (in $\mathsf{N}$)
	- $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges (in $\mathsf{C}$)
	- $r$ is the distance between the charges (in $\mathsf{m}$)
	- $\displaystyle k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}=8.99\times 10^9\ \mathsf{N\cdot m^2/C^2}$ is **Coulomb's constant**
	- $\displaystyle\epsilon_{0}=\frac{1}{4\pi k}=8.85\times 10^{-12}\ \mathsf{C^2/N\cdot m^2}$ is the **permittivity of free space**

- limitations and assumptions of Coulomb's Law #todo
	- point charges
	- objects are at rest (electrostatics force)
	- electric force
- (_Superposition principle_) The total force on a charge is the vector sum of the forces exerted by the other charges
- $\displaystyle |\vec{F}_E| = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2} = k \frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$ #todo

## Electric field

- The **electric field** of is defined as a vector field that associates to each point in space the force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal test charge at rest at that point
- SI unit of electric field is $\mathsf{N/C}=\mathsf{V/m}$
- $k$ is Coulomb's constant
- $\displaystyle E=\frac{F}{q}$ (vector form: $\displaystyle \vec{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{\vec{\mathbf{F}}}{q}$) or $\displaystyle \vec{\mathbf{E}}=\lim_{ q \to 0}\frac{\vec{\mathbf{F}}}{q}$
	- $E$ is the electric field that a charge $q$ experiences (in $\mathsf{N/C}$)
	- $F$ is the force on a charge (in $\mathsf{N}$)
	- $q$ is the **test charge** (in $\mathsf{C}$)

### Electric Field due to a Point Charge 

- $\displaystyle E =k\frac{Q}{r^2}{\color{gray}\impliedby E =\frac{F}{q}=\frac{kQq/r^2}{q}}$ 
	- $P$ is the point in space where the electric field is being calculated
	- $Q$ is the point charge creating the electric field (in $\mathsf{C}$)
	- $r$ is the distance between the point $P$ and the charge $Q$ (in $\mathsf{m}$)
	- $E$ is the electric field (at $P$) due to the source charge $Q$ (in $\mathsf{N/C}$)
	- $\vec{\mathbf{E}}=k\frac{Q}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing from $Q$ to $P$
- (_Superposition Principle_) The total electric field at a point in space is the vector sum of the electric fields due to the individual charges
	-  $\vec{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{total}}=\vec{\mathbf{E}}_1+\vec{\mathbf{E}}_2+\vec{\mathbf{E}}_3+...$ 

- $\displaystyle\vec{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int \frac{dq}{r^2} \hat{r}$ #todo

> [!Notes]
> - There is no electric charge at point $P$. But there is an electric field there. The only real charge is $Q$.
> - Notice that $E$ depends only on the charge $Q$ which produces the electric field, and not on the value of the test charge $q$.
> - In the figure, the electric field is positive, so it points towards a negative charge and away from a positive charge. But if the electric field is negative, it is the opposite.


### Relationship between electric field and potential difference

- $\displaystyle E=-\frac{V_{ba}}{d}$ is the electric field (uniform $\vec{\mathbf{E}}$)
	- $V_{ba}$ is the potential difference between points $a$ and $b$ (in $\mathsf{V}$)
	- $d$ is the distance between the points (in $\mathsf{m}$)

## Electric Field Lines

- $E=\frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}A}$ is  
	- where $A$ is the area of the Gaussian surface
- Electric field lines indicate the direction of the electric field; the field points in the direction tangent to the field line at any point (note that the field lines never cross)
- The lines are drawn such that the magnitude of the electric field, $E$, is proportional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines. The closer the lines, the stronger the field
- The lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges


- $\displaystyle \Phi_E = \int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}$
- $\displaystyle \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$
- $\displaystyle Q_{\text{total}} = \int \rho(r) dV$
