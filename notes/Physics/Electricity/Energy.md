# Electric potential energy

- **Electric potential energy** is the energy stored in a system of charges due to their positions relative to each other
- $\vec{\mathbf{E}}$ is an uniform electric field, 
- $q$ is a tiny positive charge first placed at point $a$ near the positive plate and then released from rest and accelerates toward the negative plate. 
	- $W = Fd = qEd$ is the work done by the electric field $E$ to move a charge $q$ a distance $d$
	- $\Delta \mathrm{PE}=\mathrm{PE}_b-\mathrm{PE}_a=-W$ is the change in electric potential energy when a charge $q$ moves from point $a$ to point $b$
- $W_{\text{ext}}=Q_2 V=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r}$ is the work done by an external force to move a charge $Q_2$ from infinity to a distance $r$ from a charge $Q_1$
	- $W_{\text{ext}}$ is the work done by an external force (in $\mathsf{J}$)
	- $Q_1$ is the charge creating the electric field (in $\mathsf{C}$)
	- $Q_2$ is the charge being moved (in $\mathsf{C}$)
	- $r$ is the distance between the charges (in $\mathsf{m}$)

## Electric energy

- Electric energy is the capacity to do work
- $\displaystyle E=\int _{t_0} ^t Pdt=\int _{t_0} ^t VI dt$
    - $E$ is electrical energy (in joules) absorbed or supplied by an element from time $t_0$ to time $t$
    - $P$ is power (in watts)
    - $V$ is voltage (in volts)
    - $I$ is current (in amperes)
- Units of electrical energy
	- $\mathsf{1\ J = 1\ C\cdot V}$ (joule)
	- $\mathsf{1\ kWh = 3.6\times 10^6\ J}$ (kilowatt-hour) which is the energy consumed by a 1-kilowatt appliance in 1 hour
	- $\mathsf{1\ eV = 1.6\times 10^{-19}\ J}$ (electronvolt) which is the energy acquired by a particle carrying a charge whose magnitude equals that on the electron as a result of moving through a potential difference of $1\ \mathsf{V}$
