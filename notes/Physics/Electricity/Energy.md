# Electric potential energy

$$\displaystyle U_E=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r}$$

- **Electric potential energy** is the energy stored in a system of charges due to their positions relative to each other
- The work done in bringing a charge from infinity to that point

## Electric energy

- Electric energy is the capacity to do work
- $\displaystyle E=\int _{t_0} ^t Pdt=\int _{t_0} ^t VI dt$
    - $E$ is electrical energy (in joules) absorbed or supplied by an element from time $t_0$ to time $t$
    - $P$ is power (in watts)
    - $V$ is voltage (in volts)
    - $I$ is current (in amperes)
- Units of electrical energy
	- $\mathsf{1\ J = 1\ C\cdot V}$ (joule)
	- $\mathsf{1\ kWh = 3.6\times 10^6\ J}$ (kilowatt-hour) which is the energy consumed by a 1-kilowatt appliance in 1 hour
	- $\mathsf{1\ eV = 1.6\times 10^{-19}\ J}$ (electronvolt) which is the energy acquired by a particle carrying a charge whose magnitude equals that on the electron as a result of moving through a potential difference of $1\ \mathsf{V}$
