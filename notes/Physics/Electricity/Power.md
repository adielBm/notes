# Electric power

- Electric power is the rate of transfer of electrical energy within a circuit
- $P=\frac{dE}{dt}=\frac{dE}{dq}\frac{dq}{dt}=VI$
    - $E$ is electrical energy (in joules)
    - $t$ is time (in seconds)
    - $P$ is power (in watts)
    - $V$ is voltage (in volts)
    - $I$ is current (in amperes)
    - $q$ is charge (in coulombs)
- $P=I^2R=\frac{V^2}{R}$
	- $P$ is the power dissipated by the resistor (in $\mathsf{W}$)
	- $R$ is the resistance of the resistor (in $\mathsf{\Omega}$)
	- $I$ is the current through the resistor (in $\mathsf{A}$)
