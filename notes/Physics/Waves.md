- Wave length $\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$
    - $v$ is the speed of the wave
    - $f$ is the frequency of the wave
    - $\lambda$ is the wave length

### Sine Wave & Cosine Wave

- A **sine wave** (or **sinusoid**, symbol: âˆ¿) is any function of the form $$y=A\sin(\omega t + \phi)$$
- A **cosine wave** is any function of the form $$y=A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$$
- $A$ is the amplitude
- $\omega$ is the [[Periodic Functions|angular frequency]] (in $\mathsf{rad/s}$)
- $\phi$ is the phase shift (which moves the wave left or right on the time axis)
- $t$ is the time
- $\sin$ and $\cos$ are the sine and cosine functions
- The **period** of the wave is $T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$
- The **frequency** of the wave is $f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$ (in $\mathsf{Hz}$)
- Sine and cosine waves are periodic functions with period $T$ and frequency $f$
