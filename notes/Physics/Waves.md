$$\displaystyle f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}= \frac{v}{\lambda}$$
- $f$ the **frequency** of the wave (in $\mathsf{Hz}$)
- $\omega$ is the **angular frequency** of the wave (in $\mathsf{rad/s}$)
- $T$ is the **period** of the wave (in $\mathsf{s}$)
- $v$ is the **wave speed** of the wave (in $\mathsf{m/s}$)
- $\lambda$ is the **wavelength** of the wave (in $\mathsf{m}$)

### Sine Wave

- A **sine wave** (or **sinusoid**, symbol: âˆ¿)
- $y(t)=A\sin(\omega t + \phi)$
- $A$ is the amplitude
- $\omega$ is the [[Periodic Functions|angular frequency]] (in $\mathsf{rad/s}$)
- $\phi$ is the phase shift (which moves the wave left or right on the time axis)

- $\displaystyle y(x,t)=A\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}x-\omega t+\phi\right)=A\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(x-vt)+\phi\right)$
- is the equation of a traveling wave (to the right. if it is to the left, the minus sign is replaced by a plus sign)
	- $x$ is the position of the wave we are considering
	- $vt$ is the distance the wave has traveled from the origin at time $t$



 

### Transverse Wave 

- $v=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$ is the wave speed of a transverse wave traveling along a stretched string of tension $T$ (in $\mathsf{N}$) and linear mass density $\mu$ (in $\mathsf{kg/m}$)

### Longitudinal Wave

- $v=\sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}$ 
- $v=\sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}$


## Standing Waves

- $\displaystyle v=\sqrt{\frac{F_\text{T}}{\mu}}$
- $\displaystyle\mu=\frac{m}{\ell}$ 
- $\displaystyle f_n=n\frac{v}{2\ell}=\frac{v}{\lambda_n}=nf_1$ is the frequency of the $n$th harmonic
	- $n$ is the harmonic number
	- $\ell$ is the length of the string
	- $v$ is the wave speed
	- $\lambda_n$ is the wavelength of the $n$th harmonic
- Antinodes: $x=(i+\frac{1}{2})\frac{\lambda}{2}$ for $i=0,1,2,\ldots,n$
	- $y(x,t)=A\sin(\omega t+\phi)$ at each antinode $x$
- Nodes: $x=i\frac{\lambda}{2}$ for $i=0,1,2,\ldots,n$
	- $y(x,t)=0$ at each node $x$ and every time $t$


### Energy Transport

- **Intensity** $I$ of a wave is defined as the power transported across unit area perpendicular to the direction of energy flow. 
- $I\propto A^2$
- $\displaystyle I\propto \frac{1}{r^2}$
# Oscillations



- The **natural frequency** $f_{0}$ of an oscillating system is the frequency at which the system oscillates when it is set in motion and left undisturbed.
	- $\displaystyle f_0=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$ for a mass-spring system
	- $\displaystyle f_0=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$ for a simple pendulum
- When the natural frequency and the driving frequency are the same or very close, the system exhibits **resonance**, which results in large amplitude oscillations. (which also depends on the damping)
	- At resonance, relatively small forces are required to obtain and maintain large amplitude oscillations.




- In the presence of a sinusoidal external force, a system may exhibit resonance.
- Resonance occurs when an external force is exerted at the natural frequency of an oscillating system.
