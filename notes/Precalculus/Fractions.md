- A **fraction** is an expression that represents the division of two numbers, where the number above the line is called the **numerator** and the number below the line is called the **denominator**.
- A **rational number** is a number that can be represented by a fraction $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b \neq 0$. 
	- A real number $r\in\mathbb{R}$ is rational if and only if its base-$b$ representation is finite or periodic. 
- An **irreducible fraction** is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are integers that have no other common divisors than 1 (and −1, when negative numbers are considered).
