## Questions 1-4: Apartment Building Committee  

A building has 8 floors, each with 4 apartments (North, South, West, East). A homeowners' association is formed with a chairman, a treasurer, and 2 additional representatives without specific roles.  

A total of 4 committee members are chosen from 4 different apartments (out of 32). Each apartment has exactly one eligible candidate, and each candidate is suitable for any position.  

1. What is the number of different selections of the committee?
   $\binom{32}{2}\cdot \binom{30}{2}\cdot 2!=431,520$  (D)  
2. In how many selections is at least one of the two additional representatives from a northern apartment?  `431,520 - (24 choose 2)*(30 choose 2)*2 = 191,400 ` === (C) 
3. In how many selections are the chairman and exactly one additional representative from the same floor?  `32*3*28*29 = 77,952` (A)
4. In how many selections is the chairman from floors 6-8 and the treasurer from floors 4-6?  `(30 choose 2) * ((4*11)+(8*12)) = 435 * 140 = 60,900` (C)`

## Questions 5-7: Capturing Butterflies  

A researcher captures 8 butterflies in an area with 4 species. One species (and only one) is green. Each butterfly is equally likely to be from any species.  

5. What is the probability that all 8 butterflies are from exactly two species?  (B) `6*(2^8 - 2) / 4^8`
6. What is the probability that at least one butterfly is green?  (C) 
7. What is the probability that exactly 3 of the captured butterflies are green?  (A) `(8c3) * 3^5 / 4^8`

## Questions 8-13: Distributing Hats  

A group of 20 children (10 boys, 10 girls) randomly receive 20 hats: 10 red, 5 blue, and 5 green. Hats of the same color are identical.  

8. How many possible distributions exist?  
9. What is the probability that all blue hats are given to boys?  
10. What is the probability that at least one boy and one girl receive a red hat?  
11. After distributing the hats, the children stand in a random order. What is the probability that all children with green hats stand in the left half (positions 1-10)?  
12. After distributing the hats, the children stand in a random order. What is the probability that no two children with green hats stand next to each other?  
13. The 20 hats are randomly divided into 4 equal-sized piles. What is the probability that exactly one pile contains no blue hats?  

- 8=a, 9=c, 10=b, 11=d, 12=c, 13=d

## Questions 14-17: Hostel Room Key Assignment  

A hostel has 7 double rooms. There are 14 guests (7 men, 7 women) who are actually 7 married couples, but the owner does not know this. The owner randomly distributes the 14 room keys (each room has 2 identical keys, one per guest).  

14. How many possible key assignments exist?  `(C) 14!/2^7`
15. What is the probability that exactly 5 couples receive the same key? `A = 0.00031`  
16. What is the probability that each room has one man and one woman (but not necessarily married couples)?  `D`
17. What is the probability that exactly 2 couples receive the same key? ( #TODO A)

## Questions 18-20: Matching Cups and Saucers  

There are 6 cups of different sizes and 6 matching saucers. Each saucer matches exactly one cup. The cups are placed randomly on the saucers.  

18. What is the probability that the two smallest cups are placed on the two smallest saucers (not necessarily their correct matches)?  ( #TODO i think C but mayby D)
19. What is the probability that the smallest cup is placed on the smallest saucer?  A
20. What is the probability that exactly one cup is placed on its correct matching saucer?  B
