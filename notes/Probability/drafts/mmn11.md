- $P(A)=0.85$, $P(B)=0.85$, $P(C)=0.7$, $P(ABC)=0.6$, $P(A\mid C)=1$, $P(\overline{A}\,\overline{B})=0$
- $P(A \cup B)=1$
- $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(AB)=0.85+0.85-P(AB)=1$ 
- $P(AB)=0.7$
- $C\subseteq A \implies P(CA)=P(C)=0.7$
- $P(AC)=P(ABC)+P(A\overline{B}C)\implies 0.7=0.6+P(A\overline{B}C)\implies P(A\overline{B}C)=0.1$
- $P(A)=P(AB)+P(A\overline{B})\implies 0.85=0.7+P(A\overline{B})\implies P(A\overline{B})=0.15$
- $P(A\overline{B})=P(A\overline{B}C)+P(A\overline{B}\overline{C})\implies 0.15=0.1+P(A\overline{B}\overline{C})\implies\boxed{P(A\overline{B}\overline{C})=0.05}$ 
- $P(A\overline{B}C)+P(ABC)=P(AC)\implies P(A\overline{B}C)=P(AC)-P(ABC)=0.7-0.6=0.1\implies\boxed{P(A\overline{B}C)=0.1}$
- $P(AB)=P(ABC)+P(AB\overline{C})\implies 0.7=0.6+P(AB\overline{C})\implies \boxed{P(AB\overline{C})=0.1}$
- $0.7=P(C)=P(ABC)+P(\overline{A}BC)+P(A\overline{B}C)+P(\overline{A}\overline{B}C)=0.6+P(\overline{A}BC)+0.1+0\implies P(\overline{A}BC)=0.7-0.6-0.1=0\implies\boxed{P(\overline{A}BC)=0}$
- $P(\overline{A}\,\overline{B})=0\implies \boxed{P(\overline{A}\,\overline{B}C)=0}$
- $0.85=P(B)=0.6+0.1+0+P(\overline{A}BC)\implies P(\overline{A}B\overline{C})=0.85-0.6-0.1=0.15\implies\boxed{P(\overline{A}B\overline{C})=0.15}$

### Question 2 (25 points)

Consider the following circuit where the switches are independent of each other, and each switch is closed with probability 0.6 (allowing current to flow):

#### (a) (10 points)
What is the probability that current flows from A to B?

#### (b) (7 points)
If Switch 5 is open, what is the probability that no current flows from A to B?

#### (c) (8 points)
Are the events "Switch 4 is open" and "Current flows in the circuit" independent? Prove your claim.

### Question 3 (25 points)

In a class, there are 8 boys and 8 girls. Ehud and Efrat are two of the students in the class. The class is randomly divided into 8 pairs.

#### (a) (8 points)
What is the probability that exactly two mixed pairs (one boy and one girl) are formed?

#### (b) (7 points)
If exactly two mixed pairs (one boy and one girl) are formed, what is the probability that Ehud and Efrat are not in the same pair?

#### (c) (10 points)
Five children are chosen randomly from the 16 students in the class:
1. If Efrat is chosen, what is the probability that Ehud is not chosen?
2. If Efrat is chosen, what is the probability that Ehud is chosen?

### Question 4 (25 points)

Mr. Even-Hen, a wealthy diamond merchant, decides to give his son a gift. The son must choose one of two boxes, each containing 3 stones. One box contains 2 real diamonds and 1 fake diamond, while the other box contains 2 fake diamonds and 1 real diamond. Mr. Even-Hen allows his son to choose one stone randomly from the box he chooses, and check its quality before deciding which box to take. The son adopts the following strategy: If he picks a real diamond, he will keep the box from which he selected the stone. If the stone is a fake diamond, he will take the other box.

#### (a) (10 points)
Draw a probability tree to describe the sample space of this random experiment.

#### (b) (7 points)
What is the probability that the son will choose the box with 2 real diamonds?

#### (c) (8 points)
If the son chose the other box (not the one he initially picked), what is the probability that the box contains 2 real diamonds?
