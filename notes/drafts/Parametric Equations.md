- The **parametric curve** defined by the functions $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$ (defined over an interval $I$ and called **parametric equations** of the curve) is the set of points $\{(x,y): x=f(t), y=g(t), t\in I\}$.
	- The variable $t$ is called the **parameter** of the curve. 
		- It can be thought of as time so that the point $(x,y)=(f(t),g(t))$ is the position of a particle at time $t$ tracing out the curve.
	- The interval $I$ is called the **parameter interval**.
		- If $I$ is an interval of the real numbers, the curve is called a **plane curve**.
		- If $I$ is a closed interval, $[a,b]$, the point $(f(a),g(a))$ is the **initial point** of the curve and $(f(b),g(b))$ is the **terminal point** of the curve.
